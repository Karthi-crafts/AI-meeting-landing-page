# AI-meeting-landing-page
This repository contains my submission for the **WhatBytes Product Intern Assignment**. I researched **Read AI**, then created a concept for a similar AI meeting assistant. Finally, I designed and built a responsive MVP landing page to showcase its value.

This repository showcases my work for the WhatBytes Product Intern Assignment, where I took on the role of understanding, analyzing, and shaping a product concept from scratch.

As part of the assignment, I began by diving deep into competitive product research, focusing on Read AI, a well-known AI meeting assistant. I explored its core features, target users, value propositions, and what sets it apart in the market. This research helped me understand the landscape and identify opportunities for improvement and differentiation.

Next, I used those insights to create content for a similar AI-powered meeting assistant. I wrote clear and engaging descriptions of its key features, real-world use cases, and benefits—aiming to highlight how such a tool could save time, improve meeting productivity, and offer smart summaries and analytics for teams.

Finally, I designed and built a responsive MVP landing page that brings the concept to life. The goal was to visually communicate the product’s value in a simple, clean, and compelling way—ensuring it looks great and works well across devices.

This project gave me hands-on experience with product thinking, competitive analysis, content creation, and front-end design—all essential skills for a product intern. Everything here reflects my ability to take an idea, back it up with research, and turn it into something real and functional.
